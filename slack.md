# Slack tips

1) Use private channels to organize small group conversations:

2) Use @here, @channel and @everyone to get everyone's attention (but if you only need to alert 3-4 people, prefer direct messaging to using just thoser @usernames  : see {slack notifications]( https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/help/articles/202009646-Notify-a-channel-or-workspace)
